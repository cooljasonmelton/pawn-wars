### about
Pawn Wars is a chess variant that helps people learn how chess pieces move without the needing to understand the more complicated aspects of the game. The first player to move a pawn to the other end of the board wins. 

As players get comfortable with how the pawns move, more pieces can be added so players can learn how those pieces move as well (this will be available in later versions of the app).
